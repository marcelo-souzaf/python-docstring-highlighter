# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for the extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which the language support is declared and the location of the grammar files are defined.
* `syntaxes/xxx.tmLanguage.json` - this is a Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language.
* Verify that syntax highlighting works and that the language configuration settings are working.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.
