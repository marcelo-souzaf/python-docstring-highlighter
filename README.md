# Python Docstring Highlighter (VSCode Extension)

This repository contains the source code for the Python Docstring Highlighter extension for Visual Studio Code. This extension is designed to highlight docstrings in Python code, making it easier to read and understand the code. It is optimized for the **Google** and **Sphinx** styles docstring format, but it should work partially with other formats as well.
